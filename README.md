*This is a personal project I created as part of my PBL (Project-Based Learning) journey. I built a responsive restaurant website using HTML, CSS, and media queries.

YouTube channel - Do Some Coding.

While the base structure and idea were inspired by the video from youtube, I have customized the entire layout, styles, and features according to my own design and learning. This includes modifying the footer, adding responsive sections, adjusting the grid layout, and applying my own color palette and animations.

This project helped me understand real-world application of:

CSS Grid & Flexbox

Responsive media queries

Web page structure and layouting

Footer and UI enhancements
